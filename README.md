### This is a school project! It has very low quality vibe-coded code, that is somehow even running!

To run this piece of crap:
* Clone this git project;
* Open in a dev-container or alternatively install python, torch, torch-vision and sdl3; 
* Run "make project" - to open a gui window, form where you can draw a number on a canvas and see if it was recognised;
* Or run "make train-model" - to retrain te nural network.
