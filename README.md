### This is a school project! It has very low quality vibe-coded code, that is somehow even running!

To run this piece of crap:
* Clone this git project;
* Open in a dev-container or alternatively install python, torch, torch-vision, sdl3, make and g++ compiler. If you're on macos install xcode command line tools, then copy "sdl3-macos" framework from sdl3.dmg to /Library/Frameworks;
* Run "make project-linux" or "make project-macos" - to open a gui window, form where you can draw a number on a canvas and see if it was recognised;
* Or run "make train-model" - to retrain te nural network.
